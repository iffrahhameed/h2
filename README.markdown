### H2 is a Java SQL database. The main features are:

-    Very fast
-    Open Source
-    Java
-    Embedded, Server, and Cluster
-    Disk and In Memory
-    Strong security features

### NOTICE:

This git repository is an unmodified clone of the [h2 svn repository
hosted on googlecode](http://code.google.com/p/h2database/).

I have nothing to do with the development of h2 and just thought, that it
would be nice to have a git repository of it too. Especially because of
git's submodule feature.
